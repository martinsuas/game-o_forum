<h1>Content Header</h1>
<p>The drums were pounding again, pounding and pounding and pounding.
Dacey Mormont, who seemed to be the only woman left in the hall besides Catelyn, 
stepped up behind Edwyn Frey, and touched him lightly on the arm as she said 
something in his ear. Edwyn wrenched himself away from her with unseemly violence. 
‘‘No,’’ he said, too loudly. ‘‘I’m done with dancing for the nonce.’’ Dacey paled and 
turned away. Catelyn got slowly to her feet. What just happened there? Doubt gripped 
her heart, where an instant before had been only weariness. It is nothing, she tried 
to tell herself, you are seeing grumkins in the woodpile, youare become an old silly 
woman sick with grief and fear. But something must have shown on her face. 
Even Ser Wendel Manderly took note. ‘‘Is something amiss?’’ he asked, the leg of 
lamb in his hands.</p>

<p>She did not answer him. Instead she went after Edwyn Frey. The players in the gallery 
had finally gotten both king and queen down to their name-day suits. With scarcely a 
moment’s respite, they began to play a very different sort of song. No one sang the 
words, but Catelyn knew ‘‘The Rains of Castamere’’ when she heard it. Edwyn was hurrying 
toward a door. She hurried faster, driven by the music. Six quick strides and she caught 
him. And who are you, the proud lord said, that I must bow solow? She grabbed Edwyn by 
the arm to turn him and went cold all over when she felt the iron rings beneath his silken 
sleeve.</p>

<p>Catelyn slapped him so hard she broke his lip. Olyvar, she thought, and Perwyn, 
Alesander, all absent. And Roslin wept . . .</p>

<p>Edwyn Frey shoved her aside. The music drowned all other sound, echoing off the walls as 
if the stones themselves were playing. Robb gave Edwyn an angry look and moved to block his 
way... and staggered suddenly as a quarrel sprouted from his side, just beneath the shoulder. 
If he screamed then, the sound was swallowed by the pipes and horns and fiddles. Catelyn saw a 
second bolt pierce his leg, saw him fall. Up in the gallery, half the musicians had crossbows 
in their hands instead of drums or lutes. She ran toward her son, until something punched in the 
small of the back and the hard stone floor came up to slap her. ‘‘Robb!’’ she screamed. She saw 
Smalljon Umber wrestle a table off its trestles. Crossbow bolts thudded into the wood, one two 
three, as he flung it down on top of his king. Robin Flint was ringed by Freys, their daggers 
rising and falling. Ser Wendel Manderly rose ponderously to his feet, holding his leg of lamb. 
A quarrel went in his open mouth and came out the back of his neck. Ser Wendel crashed forward, 
knocking the table off its trestles and sending cups, flagons, trenchers, platters, turnips, beets, 
and wine bouncing, spilling, and sliding across the floor.</p>
